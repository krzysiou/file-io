# file-io

Website developed to help my friends fill and send university related papers. It gathers data via many forms and creates a pdf file containing ready-to-send document. It heavily relies on react library with next.js framework. The idea came to me when at the end of second term me and many others students like me had to resend said papers many times before they were accepted by the dean.

## Technologies

- Next.js
- React
- Axios
- Cookies
- JWT

## Website setup
For starters install all modules using ```nvm use```, ```npm install```. And start hosting the website by typing ```npm run build``` and ```npm run start```, after few seconds just simply go to `localhost:3000`. It is important to notice that for cruicial features of the site you will need a serverside backend that i developed [here](https://github.com/krzysiou/file-io-api) just follow the guide there to setup server for our website.
